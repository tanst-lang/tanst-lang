## Hi there 👋
Hello my name is stella. 
I am a year eleven student at western springs colledge.
I have some experience with coding html and css as you can see in [my website](https://tanst-lang.github.io/Stella-year-10-website/). 
I take digital technology because I enjoy coding and hope to one day have a job that involves coding or 3d modeling
my favorite games to play at the moment are the Batman Arkham trilogy games
